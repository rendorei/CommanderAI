"""Budget-aware deck construction helpers.

The ``--budget`` flag caps the deck's total estimated USD price (using Scryfall
prices). Budget is enforced in three stages:

1. ``filter_candidates_by_budget`` removes any single candidate that already
   exceeds the budget on its own, so neither the heuristic nor the LLM can pick
   a card that can never fit.
2. The LLM is told the budget via an extra instruction (prices are already in
   the prompt).
3. ``enforce_budget`` runs after the full deck is assembled and greedily swaps
   the most expensive cards for cheaper alternatives until the deck fits — or
   reports that the budget could not be met with the available pool.
